## Task description

Santa is ready to distribute the presents for this Christmas, in a nearby town.  

His bag can only carry a maximum of 50kg of presents so the reindeers don’t get tired during their journey (and because of Santa's back problem).  
- Presents come in blue, red, yellow and green wrapping paper.  
- Inside the bag the presents are stacked, from heavier to lighter.  
- There can't be adjacent presents with same color, to add more variety.  

Find the best way to maximize the present weight following those conditions.  

Example:  
```
max = 50kg

presentWeights = [(5, red), (4, blue), (15, green), (14, yellow), (12, green), (2, blue), (6, red)]

solution = [(15, green), (14, yellow), (12, green), (6, red), (2, blue)]
```
